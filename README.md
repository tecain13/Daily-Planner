### Problem

People rarely utilize physical/book-style planners anymore. Online planner apps should be user-friendly and intuitive. 

### Solution
Digital planners allow people to understand what their day entails and help them to effectively budget their time.

## Technical Overview
Functional, deployed application.

GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
